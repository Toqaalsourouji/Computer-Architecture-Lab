# Computer Architecture Lab - RISC-V Projects

This repo contains Verilog code and testbenches from the Computer Architecture lab. The highlight is a simple **RISC-V single-cycle processor** that supports 7 instructions:

- **add** – Performs addition of two registers and stores the result in the destination register.
- **sub** – Subtracts the value of one register from another and stores the result.
- **and** – Executes a bitwise AND operation between two registers.
- **or** – Executes a bitwise OR operation between two registers.
- **lw** – Loads a word from memory into a register.
- **sw** – Stores the contents of a register into memory.
- **beq** – Compares two registers and branches to a specified address if they are equal.

These instructions form the core of basic computational and control operations, providing the foundational framework for more complex architectures.
